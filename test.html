            Darkseid is a character from the DCEU created by Jack Kirby ,And you know how them kirby boys roll.This Guy was made to literary torment Superman and traumatize everyone else except for the Bat of course.A hero is only as good as the villain so if you thought Superman was Great then You're really in it with Darkseid, Or as he'd put it "My Omega-Beams beg to Differ".
